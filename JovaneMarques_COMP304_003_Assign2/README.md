# Movie Theater App
A movie theater approached you to develop an Android application which allows the audience to buy a
ticket using their smart phone and consider the following instructions. The main screen will display a
theater logo (it may be a real - cineplex or imaginary theater) and a button labelled "Buy Your Ticket".
The second screen allows the audience to choose the movie list (Glass, Bumblebee, Escape Room,
Replicas and The Mule). Use a menu to implement this list. The next screen prompts the audience to click
on the preferred showtime (12:50pm, 2:15pm, 4:45pm, 6.50pm and 8:50pm). Use radio button controls to
show the preferred showtime.
After selecting a show time, the patron will be prompted to select the types of ticket (adult and children)
using check boxes and use edit text or spinner to give number of tickets (quantity) for each category.
The checkout screen prompts the patron to provide the personal and credit card information. Use Edit
Text controls and other UI elements to allow the user to enter the personal information: first name, last
name, email, and credit card details. The rest of the fields will be different for each student. For example,
you may create fields phone number, user name, password etc. Create 2-3 fields named as mentioned
above. Provide validation for these entries by setting xml attributes and / or java code validations.
Use TextView objects to create the label components for your UI. Allow the user to use "Back" key to go
back to the previous screen. Display the ticket information on the check-out screen when the user clicks
on a button titled “Confirm Your Ticket”. This will show the ticket details as follows in the next screen.
1Name: John Smith
Movie Name: Bumblebee
Show time: 12:50pm
No of Tickets: Adult -2 and Children -2
Use styles and themes to create a nice look and feel of your app. Use drawable objects or png images to
show the logo for the theater, and movies etc.
